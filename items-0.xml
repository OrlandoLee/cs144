        <Description>Brand new medium Gianni Versace women's jacket in perfect condition. This item was bought by family members as a gift and I can not confirm if this is an authentic jacket or not. It still has its tag on it. The label says, "Made in Italy" and "GV" on the interior. This would be a great Christmas present to anybody. I accept paypal, money order, and personal checks. Buyer will pay for shipping. Remember to check out my other auctions. Happy bidding and good luck. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!
