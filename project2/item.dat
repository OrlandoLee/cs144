Profiles in History's Once in a Lifetime Experiences presents Dinner with Robert. H. Justman! What Star Trek fan wouldn't jump at the chance to spend an evening with one of the most beloved figures in Star Trek History? One very fortunate bidder will have that chance. The esteemed Mr. Justman needs no introduction to Star Trek fans, but here is an opportunity to spend a private evening with a true gentleman, a charming conversationalist, a genuine insider and a font of Star Trek knowledge, at one of the most \"in\" spots in LA - the famous Wolfgang Puck restaurant - Spago's Beverly Hills If you are the high bidder, you and a guest will be flown to Los Angeles where your personal Towncar awaits you. You will glide in luxury up the famous 405 freeway and down Sunset Boulevard, through Beverly Hills and into the heart of Hollywood, where your room at the grand old historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel has been reserved. This is the true Grande Dame of Hollywood - the site of the first Academy Awards Presentation and the glamorous gathering place of the biggest stars in Motion Picture History. Here, you will have time to relax, and freshen up before you meet Mr. Justman and his gracious, elegant wife for dinner. Your Towncar will drive you to Spago's where the food is the exquisite and the clientele exclusive. This is a unique and very limited opportunity to ask the questions you've always wanted to ask, discuss the subjects you want to discuss - and experience the luxury of a private dinner with a Star Trek legend. Of course Jamie Lee Curtis or Billy Crystal just might be at the next table. But you'll probably be so engrossed in Mr. Justman's tales and anecdotes (not only of Star Trek but his many, many other shows) that you won't even notice. When your dinner is over - your Towncar awaits to return you to your hotel, or to explore LA Nightlife on your own. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is across from the Chinese Theater, convenient to Universal Studios, the Sunset Strip, and other major attractions, and only one block from the brand new entertainment & shopping Complex, Hollywood and Highland! Be the first to go where no fan has gone before - into the private life of this distinguished and beloved repository of Star Trek lore.
